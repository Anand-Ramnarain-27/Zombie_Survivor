# Zombie_Survivor

This journey began as part of a collaborative effort, where each member of the team brought their unique skills to the table. My skills lie within the intricate world of coding, a realm where game mechanics come to life through algorithms and logic.

Our collective vision for this project is known as "Zombie Survivor," a roguelike adventure game to challenge players' survival instincts in the face of relentless undead hordes. From the outset, my focus was firmly on the technical aspect of the game, driven by a curiosity to dissect and understand the intricacy behind gameplay mechanics.

As the project unfolded, my role took into shaping the technical side of this project. I delved into crafting the backbone of our game: the player controller, health system, damage mechanics, and the rewarding progression to keep players hooked. 

One feature, in particular, I am most proud of was inspired by Cyberpunkâ€”a temporal manipulation mechanic that slowed time while mirroring the player's actions with duplicate bodies. Translating this concept into code was a multifaceted journey, requiring a step-by-step approach to achieve the desired effect.

The first phase involved the replication of the player's avatar, creating copies of their movements at intervals. Utilizing a copy pool mechanism, I devised a method to manage these duplicates efficiently, ensuring optimal performance without overloading the system.

The next challenge was in the time manipulation aspect. Here, I encountered hurdles that a lot of solutions. Rather than slowing down time for the entire game, I opted to selectively slow down specific aspects of the game world. By applying this to projectile velocities and enemy movements, I achieved the illusion of time slowing down while maintaining gameplay flow.

Yet, even as the project takes shape. This project is still ongoing. But here is what we have created so far.
